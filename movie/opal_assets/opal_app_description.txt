[App Description]
I want to build a "AI Video Production Assistant" tool.
The tool should accept a "JSON Manifest" text input containing a list of video shots (fields: shot_id, character, action_prompt).

For each shot processing, the app needs to:
1. Parse the input JSON to extract specific shot details.
2. Enhance the 'action_prompt' by injecting specific visual descriptions for characters:
   - If character is "HOST", add: "Cute tuxedo cat wearing a headset, enthusiastic expression, Pixar Style 3D".
   - If character is "NVDA", add: "Black cat with green glowing eyes, wearing a leather jacket, cool vibe, Nvidia green theme".
   - If character is "TSLA", add: "White cat in a space suit, floating in zero gravity, crazy eyes, Mars background".
3. Output the final "Enhanced Prompt" that is optimized for Google Veo (Video Generation Model).

The UI should have:
- A large text area for "Input Manifest".
- A selector or input for "Shot ID" to process.
- A display area for the "Final Veo Prompt".
- A button to "Generate Video" using the Veo model with the generated prompt.
