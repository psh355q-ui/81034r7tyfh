# 📅 Daily Development Log: 2026-01-26

## 🎯 Summary
Successfully stabilized the War Room MVP (3+1 Agent System) and verified key AI integrations. Fixed critical bugs preventing the `Analysis` page from displaying results and improved the system's ability to discover news for new or unknown tickers.

## ✅ Accomplishments

### 1. War Room MVP Stabilization
- **Fixed 500 Internal Server Error**: Resolved an `ImportError` in `war_room_mvp.py` where `PersonaMode` was being imported from a non-existent path.
- **Fixed Frontend Analysis UI**:
  - Addressed a data structure mismatch between Backend and Frontend.
  - Flattened the `analyze_ticker` API response to match the Frontend's `AIDecision` interface (`action`, `conviction` at top level).
  - Fixed action mapping logic where `REJECT` was incorrectly mapped to `SELL`. It now correctly maps to `HOLD`.

### 2. Data Pipeline Enhancements
- **Fixed Missing News for CRWV**:
  - Identified that `CRWV` (CoreWeave) was missing from the ticker mapping, causing news fetch failures.
  - Added explicit mapping: `CRWV` ↔ `["CoreWeave", "코어위브", "코어웨이브"]`.
- **Implemented Dynamic Ticker Mapping**:
  - Implemented a fallback mechanism using `yfinance`.
  - If a ticker is not in the static list, the system now automatically fetches the company short name, cleans it (removes 'Inc', 'Corp'), and uses it for news searches.
  - **Impact**: Removed the need for manual maintenance of ticker mappings.

### 3. AI & News Integration Verification
- **Ollama Integration Verified**:
  - Executed `backend/test_ollama.py`.
  - Confirmed successful initialization of Ollama client (Localhost:11434).
  - Verified local embedding generation.
  - Verified Sentiment Analysis on sample news.
  - Confirmed `NewsProcessor` pipeline integration is working correctly.

## 📝 Next Steps (Tomorrow)
- **Live Trading Test**: With the analysis pipeline stabilized and news fetching improved, we are ready for a supervised live trading test.
- **Performance Tuning**: Monitor latency of the Two-Stage Agent architecture during live operation.
